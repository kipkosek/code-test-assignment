QA TEST SCENARIOS

I have written these use cases in Gherkin's Given-When-Then format because I find it to be a helpful way of specifying expected behavior.

**Basic Search**

Scenario: Search cocktails by keyword on home page
When search term <keyword> is entered on the home page
Then cocktail cards with name containing <keyword> are displayed

Scenario: Search cocktails by keyword on cocktails page
When search term <keyword> is entered on the cocktails page
Then cocktail cards with name containing <keyword> are displayed

Scenario: Search term with no results on home page goes to cocktails page
When a search term is entered on the home page that returns no results
Then the cocktails page is displayed
(Is this expected behavior? Should the cocktails page display 'No records found.'?)

Scenario: Search term with no results on cocktails page displays message
When a search term is entered on the cocktails page that returns no results
Then a 'No records found.' message is displayed

**Randomized Search**

Scenario: Random Recipe button displays random recipe
When the Random Recipe button on the home page is clicked
Then a random recipe is displayed

Scenario: Random recipe is different from previous random recipe
Given the Random Recipe button on the home page has been clicked
And a random recipe has been displayed
When the Random Recipe button is clicked again
Then a different random recipe is displayed

**Viewing Result(s)**

Scenario: Clicking on Cocktail List button displays cocktails page
When the Cocktail List button is clicked on the home page
Then the cocktails page is displayed 

Scenario: View Recipe button displays recipe details
Given a cocktail card is displayed
When the view recipe button is clicked
Then the recipe details are displayed

Scenario: Return to List link displays cocktails page
Given the recipe details are displayed
When the Return to List link is clicked
Then the main cocktails page is displayed

Scenario: Card and table view icons display cocktails correctly
Given the cocktail cards are in {card/table} view
When the {card/table} view icon is clicked
Then the cards are displayed in {card/table} format

Scenario: Navigation arrows advance cocktail pages
Given the full list of cocktails is displayed
When the {left/right} arrow is clicked
Then the list moves to the {previous/next} page

**Search + Filtering Result(s)**

Scenario Outline: Filter cocktails
When <filterName> has been selected from <filterType>
Then only cocktail cards with <filterName> are displayed
Examples:
| filterType | filterName |
| Category | Punch/Party Drink |
| Ingredient | Gin |
| Alcoholic | Non alcoholic |
| Glass | Highball Glass |
(Suggestion for improvement: Allow filtering in multiple categories at once.)
