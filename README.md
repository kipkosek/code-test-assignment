# Project Overview - TequilaMockingbird

The purpose of this project is to supply a project to test your code-testing abilities. Included is a small webapp that pulls from an API, and displays results. There's also an e2e testbed ([Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/)) as well as a unit test testbed ([Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io)). See below or `package.json` for details on running each.

## Tasks to Complete
Please make it as far as you can, and add additional test cases where you see fit to. 

> Note: If you are unfamiliar with TypeScript/JavaScript test writing, and feel more comfortable writing test suites in alternative tools and test runners, please feel free to implement using them and bundle that with appropriate instructions on how to run and/or a way for us to repeat the same process. 

### QA Suite (documentation)
First up, let's build a QA suite for testing the functionality of this applications. There are a few user flows involved with finding drinks, please go through and document an appropriate QA process for each featureset:
- Basic search
- Randomized search
- Viewing result(s)
- Search + Filtering result(s)

Be sure to include possible bugs, areas for improvement, considerations for different device types, etc in your suite. You can just check in related file(s) to a directory in the repo (`docs/` for example).

### Unit Tests
Additionally, there are a handfull of test files (`*.spec.ts`) that are filled with either failing units (example `src/app/services/cocktail.service.spec.ts`) or prompts to add unit tests (example `src/app/pipes/truncate.pipe.spec.ts`). 

The tasks to complete are marked by both `// TODO:` markers as well as filled with a failing test (`expect(false).toBeTruthy();`). Please see and complete those if possible.

### E2E / Integration Tests
Lastly, there's an e2e spec file (`app.e2e-spec.ts`) that has empty test clauses for your attention.

## Delivery on Completion
Please push your completed code repository to a remote repository (GitHub, Bitbucket) and provide us with the url and public access.


## Getting Project Started

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.3.

In order to get this project running, you will need NodeJS installed on your machine. You will then need to install the project dependencies (via `npm install` from the project directory), and follow below to run the project. Any questions about this process please do reach out sooner rather than later. 

### More Info 

- Using Angular 9 (as mentioned below), Angular Material, and NGXS for state management throughout.

## How To

### Run development server

Run `npm run start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Running tests 
Running tests a single time and generating coverage reports - `ng test --no-watch --code-coverage`

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
